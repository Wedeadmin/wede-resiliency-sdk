# Contributing to WEDE Resiliency SDK

Thank you for your interest in contributing to WEDE.

This repository exists to provide a stable, open-source integration surface and tooling that demonstrate engineering maturity while protecting WEDE’s proprietary core architecture (patent pending).

## What contributions are welcome
We welcome contributions that improve the quality and usability of the open-source layer, including:
- Documentation improvements and clarifications
- Contract tests and fixtures
- Integration simulators and tooling
- Reference integrations that demonstrate flow-preserving usage
- Bug fixes in public SDK interfaces or adapters

All contributions must respect the boundaries defined below.

## Contribution boundaries (important)
This repository must not include:
- Core continuity decision logic
- Routing, scoring, or optimization strategies
- Reconciliation heuristics or state management internals
- Production provider configurations or redundancy tables
- Any implementation attempting to replicate or reverse-engineer WEDE’s proprietary engine

Pull requests that violate these boundaries will be closed.

## Development workflow
1) Fork the repository
2) Create a feature branch
3) Make focused, well-documented changes
4) Add or update tests where applicable
5) Submit a pull request with a clear description of intent

## Coding standards
- Keep interfaces minimal and explicit
- Avoid introducing unnecessary dependencies
- Prefer deterministic behavior for tests and simulators
- Do not introduce secrets or credentials into the codebase

## Intellectual Property
By submitting a contribution:
- You confirm that you have the right to submit the code
- You agree that your contribution is licensed under the repository’s Apache 2.0 license
- You acknowledge that WEDE’s core architecture remains proprietary and is not affected by contributions to this repository

## Review process
All pull requests are reviewed for:
- Technical correctness
