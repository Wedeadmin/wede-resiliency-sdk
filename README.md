Wede is a middleware layer designed to provide Offline Resiliency for DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks). It ensures that edge devices (sensors, cameras, trackers) can maintain state synchronization and local consensus even when IP connectivity degrades or fails (e.g., during 5G/4G outages).
